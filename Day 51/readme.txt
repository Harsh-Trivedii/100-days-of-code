Question: Given an array arr[ ] of length N consisting cost of N toys and an integer K depicting the amount with you. 
Your task is to find maximum number of toys you can buy with K amount. 

Example:
Input: 
N = 7 
K = 50
arr[] = {1, 12, 5, 111, 200, 1000, 10}
Output: 4
Explaination: The costs of the toys 
you can buy are 1, 12, 5 and 10.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N * Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ K, arr[i] ≤ 109

Test cases: 41/41
