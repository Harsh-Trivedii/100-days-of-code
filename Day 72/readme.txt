Problem: Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion

Question:Given an array arr of distinct elements of size N, the task is to rearrange the elements of the array in a zig-zag fashion so that the converted array should be in the below form: 

arr[0] < arr[1]  > arr[2] < arr[3] > arr[4] < . . . . arr[n-2] < arr[n-1] > arr[n]. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
0 <= Arri <= 106


Test Cases Passed: 
340 /340
