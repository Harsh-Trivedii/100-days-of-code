Problem: Reverse array in groups

Question: Given an array arr[] of positive integers of size N. Reverse every sub-array group of size K.

Example:

Input:
N = 5, K = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 3 2 1 5 4
Explanation: First group consists of elements
1, 2, 3. Second group consists of 4,5.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N, K ≤ 107
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1018

Test Cases Passed: 
110 /110
