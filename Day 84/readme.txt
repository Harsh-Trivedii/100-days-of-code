Problem:Print alternate elements of an array

Question:You are given an array A of size N. You need to print elements of A in alternate order (starting from index 0).

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output:
1 3

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 105

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Test Cases Passed: 
200 /200
