Program: Constructor Overloading
Question: A program that demonstrates the concept of constructor overloading where one constructor will be default and another will be parameterized.
Explanation: the concept of having more than one constructor with different parameters so that every constructor can perform a different task.

Sample Input: 
For constructor 1: 10 20 20
For constructor 2: 5 5 6

Sample Output: 
For constructor 1: 10 20 20 
Area of Rectangle: 200
Area of Square: 400
For constructor 2: 5 5 6
Area of Rectangle: 25
Area of Square: 36
