Problem:Swap kth elements

Question: Given an array Arr of size N, swap the Kth element from beginning with Kth element from end.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8, K = 3
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Output: 1 2 6 4 5 3 7 8
Explanation: Kth element from beginning is
3 and from end is 6.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 103

Test Cases Passed: 
210 /210
