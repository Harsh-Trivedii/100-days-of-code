Problem: Largest subarray with 0 sum

Question: Given an array having both positive and negative integers. The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.

Example:

Input:
N = 8
A[] = {15,-2,2,-8,1,7,10,23}
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest subarray with
sum 0 will be -2 2 -8 1 7.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000, for each valid i

Test Cases: 405 / 405
