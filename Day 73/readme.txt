Problem: Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

Question: Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

Example:

Input: 
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
0 0 1 2 2
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= A[i] <= 2

Test Cases Passed: 
35 /35
