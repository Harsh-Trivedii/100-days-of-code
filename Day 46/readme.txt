Problem: Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)

Explanation:
Inorder:In the case of binary search trees (BST), Inorder traversal gives nodes in non-decreasing order.
Preorder: Preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree. Preorder traversal is also used to get prefix expressions on an expression tree.
Postorder:Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree.Postorder traversal is also useful to get the postfix expression of an expression tree

Sample Input:
4 2 5 1 3
Sample Output:
Inorder traversal of binary tree is 
4 2 5 1 3 
Preorder traversal of binary tree is 
1 2 4 5 3
Postorder traversal of binary tree is 
4 5 2 3 1 

Time Complexity: O(N)
