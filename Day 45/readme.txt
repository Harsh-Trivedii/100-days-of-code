Question Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/array-subset-of-another-array2317/1?page=1&curated[]=1&sortBy=submissions
Question:Given two arrays: a1[0..n-1] of size n and a2[0..m-1] of size m. 
Task is to check whether a2[] is a subset of a1[] or not. Both the arrays can be sorted or unsorted.

Example:

Input:
a1[] = {11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7}
a2[] = {11, 3, 7, 1}
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
a2[] is a subset of a1[]

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= n,m <= 105
1 <= a1[i], a2[j] <= 106

Test Cases: 209 / 209
