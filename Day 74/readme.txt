Problem: Equilibrium Point

Question: Given an array A of n positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibrium Point in an array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Example:
Input: 
n = 5 
A[] = {1,3,5,2,2} 
Output: 3 
Explanation:  
equilibrium point is at position 3 
as elements before it (1+3) = 
elements after it (2+2).

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 106
1 <= A[i] <= 108

Test Cases Passed: 
210 /210
