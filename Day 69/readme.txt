Problem: First element to occur k times

Question: Given an array of N integers. Find the first element that occurs at least K number of times

Example:
Input :
N = 7, K = 2
A[] = {1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7}
Output :
4
Explanation:
Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. 
But 4 is first that occurs 2 times
As at index = 4, 4 has occurred 
atleast 2 times whereas at index = 6,
7 has occurred atleast 2 times.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1 <= N, K <= 105
1<= A <= 106

Test Cases Passed: 
1130 /1130
