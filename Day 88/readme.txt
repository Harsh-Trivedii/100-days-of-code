Question: Given an array of N distinct elements, the task is to find all elements in array except two greatest elements in sorted order.

Example 1:

Input : 
a[] = {2, 8, 7, 1, 5}
Output :
1 2 5 
Explanation :
The output three elements have two or
more greater elements. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 105
-106 ≤ Ai ≤ 106

Test Cases Passed: 
50 /50
