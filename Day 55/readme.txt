Problem:Implement strstr
Question:Your task is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments (s,x) and  locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. 
The function returns and integer denoting the first occurrence of the string x in s (0 based indexing).

Example:
Input:
s = GeeksForGeeks, x = Fr
Output: -1
Explanation: Fr is not present in the
string GeeksForGeeks as substring.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|*|x|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= |s|,|x| <= 100

Test Cases Passed: 
211 /211
