Question: Given two strings a and b. The task is to find if the string 'b' can be obtained by rotating another string 'a' by exactly 2 places.

Example:
Input:
a = amazon
b = azonam
Output: 1
Explanation: amazon can be rotated anti
clockwise by two places, which will make
it as azonam.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxilary Complexity: O(N).
Challenge: Try doing it in O(1) space complexity.

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of a, b ≤ 105

Test Cases Passed: 
110 /110
