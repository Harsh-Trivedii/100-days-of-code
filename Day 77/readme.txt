Program: Anagram

Question: Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, 
only the order of characters can be different. For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.

Example: 
Input:a = allergy, b = allergic
Output: NO
Explanation: Characters in both the strings are 
        not same, so they are not anagrams.
        
Expected Time Complexity:O(|a|+|b|).
Expected Auxiliary Space:O(Number of distinct characters).

Constraints:
1 ≤ |a|,|b| ≤ 105
