Problem: Fascinating Number

Question: Given a number N. Your task is to check whether it is fascinating or not.
Fascinating Number: When a number(should contain 3 digits or more) is multiplied by 2 and 3 ,
and when both these products are concatenated with the original number, then it results in all digits from 1 to 9 present exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 192
Output: Fascinating
Explanation: After multiplication with 2
and 3, and concatenating with original
number, number will become 192384576 
which contains all digits from 1 to 9.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
100 <= N <= 2*109

Test Cases Passed: 
10492 /10492
