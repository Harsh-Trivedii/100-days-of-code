Problem: Longest Common Prefix in an Array

Question: Given a array of N strings, find the longest common prefix among all strings present in the array.

Example:
Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {geeksforgeeks, geeks, geek,
         geezer}
Output: gee
Explanation: "gee" is the longest common
prefix in all the given strings.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*max(|arri|)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(max(|arri|)) for result.


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 103
1 ≤ |arri| ≤ 103
